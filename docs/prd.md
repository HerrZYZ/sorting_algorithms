## Original Requirements
The boss has asked for the creation of three different types of sorting algorithms in C++.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a product that efficiently implements three different types of sorting algorithms in C++.",
    "Ensure the product is user-friendly and easily understandable for users with basic knowledge of C++.",
    "Ensure the product is efficient and optimized for performance."
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily input my data to be sorted.",
    "As a user, I want to be able to choose which sorting algorithm to use.",
    "As a user, I want to be able to understand the output of the sorting algorithm.",
    "As a user, I want the sorting process to be fast and efficient.",
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily integrate this product into my existing C++ projects."
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "C++ Standard Library: Provides a sort function, but does not offer different sorting algorithms to choose from.",
    "Boost C++ Libraries: Offers a wide range of functionalities, but may be too complex for users who only need sorting algorithms.",
    "STLSoft: Provides a variety of algorithms, but not specifically focused on sorting.",
    "Poco C++ Libraries: Offers a wide range of functionalities, but may be too complex for users who only need sorting algorithms.",
    "ACE (Adaptive Communication Environment): Provides a wide range of functionalities, but may be too complex for users who only need sorting algorithms.",
    "JUCE: A wide-ranging library, but not focused on sorting algorithms.",
    "Loki: Provides a variety of algorithms, but not specifically focused on sorting."
]
```

```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a C++ program that implements three different types of sorting algorithms. The user should be able to easily input their data, choose the sorting algorithm, and understand the output. The product should be optimized for performance and easily integrable into existing C++ projects.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement three different types of sorting algorithms", "P0"),
    ("Create a user-friendly interface for data input", "P0"),
    ("Allow users to choose the sorting algorithm", "P0"),
    ("Ensure the output is easily understandable", "P0"),
    ("Optimize the product for performance", "P1")
]
```

## UI Design draft
As this is a C++ program, the UI will be command-line based. The user will be prompted to input their data, choose the sorting algorithm, and the sorted data will be outputted in the command line. The layout will be clean and straightforward to ensure ease of use.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
