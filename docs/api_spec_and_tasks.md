## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application. It uses argparse to handle user input and calls the appropriate sorting algorithm."),
    ("bubble_sort.py", "Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm."),
    ("quick_sort.py", "Implements the Quick Sort algorithm."),
    ("merge_sort.py", "Implements the Merge Sort algorithm."),
    ("sort_utils.py", "Contains utility functions used by the sorting algorithms.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "sort_utils.py",
    "bubble_sort.py",
    "quick_sort.py",
    "merge_sort.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'sort_utils.py' contains utility functions that are used by the sorting algorithms. These functions include swap() for swapping two elements in an array and partition() for partitioning an array around a pivot element.

The sorting algorithms are implemented in 'bubble_sort.py', 'quick_sort.py', and 'merge_sort.py'. Each of these files contains a sort() function that takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array.

'main.py' is the main entry point of the application. It uses the argparse library to handle user input. The user can specify the array to be sorted and the sorting algorithm to be used.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. The main entry point of the application is 'main.py', which uses the argparse library to handle user input. The sorting algorithms are implemented in separate files and are called by the main application as needed.
